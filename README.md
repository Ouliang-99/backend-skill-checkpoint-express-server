## Setup Instructions

To set up this API for local development, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
   - You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm** (Node Package Manager)
   - npm comes bundled with Node.js, but if you need to install it separately, you can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

3. **PostgreSQL** (or any compatible relational database)
   - Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   - You need to have a database set up for the API to interact with.

4. **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)
   - If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### 1. Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Ouliang-99/backend-skill-checkpoint-express-server.git

2. Navigate to the project folder
Go into the project folder:

cd your-repository-name

3. Install dependencies
To install all necessary dependencies, run the following command:

npm install

This will install all the required Node.js packages listed in the package.json file.

4. Set up the environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, or copy the .env.example file and modify it according to your setup.

Hereâ€™s an example of the variables you'll need to configure:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name

5. Set up the database

6. Start the server
Once everything is set up, you can start the server using the following command:

npm run start (you can change it in file package.json line: 7 )

This will start the server on http://localhost:4001. You can now test the API using Postman or by visiting the Swagger API documentation at http://localhost:4001/api-docs to interact with the endpoints.

7. Test the API
You can test the API endpoints using tools like:

- Postman: Import the API documentation or manually test each endpoint.
- Swagger UI: Open the Swagger UI at http://localhost:4001/api-docs to interact with the API directly from your browser.
